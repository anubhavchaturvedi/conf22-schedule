       "      <td>Got assets? We all do, yet we all struggle to identify and contextualize those assets. If only we could rely on our CMDB! At .conf21, we discussed the basics of how to do this with Splunk® Enterprise Security and the asset and identity framework. Join us this year as we go deeper and answer some of your best questions from that session. We'll focus on the technical and architectural aspects of integrating asset data into Splunk Enterprise Security, look at the scalability of the ES asset and identity framework and dive into the Key Value (KV) Store. We'll include some more detailed examples of setting up asset and identity data in a real-world context. Let's also investigate how best to set up asset and identity framework (A&amp;I) in order to take advantage of the risk framework and RBA!</td>\n",

However, many people's first instincts take them to the \"join,\" \"append,\" and \"transaction\" commands which often come with unexpected limits and slow performance. Come to this talk to learn how to avoid these commands *almost* entirely, leverage the eval and stats commands instead of pushing most of the reporting work to the indexer tier, and how to check whether you're doing things correctly.
